# TODO List for Facial Emotion Recognition Project Initialization

- [x] Create requirements.txt with necessary dependencies (opencv-python, fer, etc.)
- [x] Create main.py script for basic facial emotion recognition and sleep detection
- [x] Update README.md with project description and setup instructions
- [x] Create basic folder structure (data/ and models/ directories)
- [x] Install dependencies using pip
- [x] Test the basic functionality of the app (webcam access issue resolved by trying multiple indices)
