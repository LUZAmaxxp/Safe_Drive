# TODO List for Facial Emotion Recognition Project Initialization

- [x] Create requirements.txt with necessary dependencies (opencv-python, fer, etc.)
- [x] Create main.py script for basic facial emotion recognition and sleep detection
- [x] Update README.md with project description and setup instructions
- [x] Create basic folder structure (data/ and models/ directories)
- [x] Install dependencies using pip
- [x] Test the basic functionality of the app (webcam access issue resolved by trying multiple indices)
- [x] Add a basic emotion recognition model to the models/ folder
- [x] Train the model on FER2013 dataset (sample dataset used for demonstration)
- [x] Implement security best practices (environment config, logging, input validation, secure coding)
- [x] Add comprehensive unit tests for utilities and configuration
- [x] Create secure version of the application (main_secure.py)
